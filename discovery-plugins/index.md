# Discovery Plugins


Discovery Plugins provide a convenient way to further enrich or explore. Some type
uses for discovery plugins would be:
- Lookup a site and its changes through Web Archive
- Launch a search for a business in Open Secrets, the Panama Papers or LinkedIn
- Open another tool to extract the names and emails on the collected page
- Launch a digital forensics tool to inspect the contents of a collected file
- Enrich the geospatial or temporal data of a collected item

Discovery Plugins let you hook into other data providers or toolmakers to 
help you get the most breadth and depth from your collections
