# Content
Content is anything that is collected or uploaded into the OSINT LIAR software. Within the content
is data that you want to dig through to determine if there is worthwhile information. Combining information
with data analysis, data visualizations and insight provides knowledge. Since content is highly variable
there is a flexible system in place to accommodate even the trickiest data to wrangle.
