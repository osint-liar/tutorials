# File Uploads
OSINT LIAR does many upload options that can be confusing. In this section, we are only going to talk
about uploading a singular file and a zip file. This action can only be performed within the context 
of the OSINT LIAR Extension popup. 

### Single File Upload
Here is a short video of a PDF being uploaded. Any type of file can be uploaded. Only certain types
of files will have their content's indexed and made searchable.
