### Capture the webpage
Doing a manual capture of a web page is as simple as right-clicking your mouse and selecting the "Capture" option. 
This will capture the contents on the web page. If you do not see the option move your mouse to a different 
part of the web page. Click the image to watch the video.

### Capture an image
Doing a manual image capture is as simple as right-clicking your mouse and selecting the "Add To Media Gallery" option. 
This will capture the image that your cursor is hovering over, on the web page. **IMPORTANT**, some sites block you from
right-clicking on an image, to get around this use another extension that enables the right-click action, regardless.
