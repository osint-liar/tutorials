# Tags  

Tags allow you to annotate our data with a short snippet of text. Hashtags are
popular for labeling your data so that you can efficiently find it later.

For example, you collect a large number of pages and documents from social media
sites. Instead of searching by domain to find all your related social media,
you can just filter by a tag.
