# Template Reports

Reporting is hard. The needs of the end user differ case by case. The template reports approach is to allow
for individuals or organizations that have a reporting standard to easily implement it, so it is compatible with
their OSINT LIAR instance. OSINT LIAR uses an open source approach to its reporting system. The current report
templates are readily accessible on github.com. They can be reviewed, cloned, forked and made to run locally. This 
enables the differing needs of the users to be met. There are two report data formats that are available. 
- Windows Word
- PDF

After you save the report, you will be able to export it in the above formats.
